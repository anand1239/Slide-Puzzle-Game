# Description 
This game consists of a large square divided into 16 smaller squares. Fifteen of these squares are numbered from 1 to 15, and one square is empty. Initially, the numbered squares are arranged in a random order. The only possible move is to swap the empty square with an adjacent numbered square. The objective of the game is to arrange the numbered squares in increasing order from 1 to 15.
